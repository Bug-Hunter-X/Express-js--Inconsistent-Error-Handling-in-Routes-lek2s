# Express.js Inconsistent Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inconsistent error handling in routes.

The `bug.js` file showcases a route that uses a simple `if` check to handle the case where a user is not found. However, it lacks robust error handling for database errors or other potential issues.

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to improve the error handling using a `try...catch` block to gracefully handle exceptions and provide informative error responses.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install Express.js.
4. Run the `bug.js` file using `node bug.js`.
5. Make requests to `/users/:id` to observe the error handling (or lack thereof).
6. Compare the behavior to the `bugSolution.js` file.
